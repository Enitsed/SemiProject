# semiproject
SemiProject for 2 weeks

This is a team project so i didn`t write all of the codes.
When i merged all the code my team mates wrote to the main code, I realized this was going hell.
As this is just an academic team project, i just had to mention all of these code are not written by me but some.
i took over the part of board action and had to spend time to make old plugins work which other two team mates urged to implement,
eventually we decided to removed them though. they keep them in their source code, when i tried to merge.

Anyway, i concluded this project was shittest prject and will ever be... 
I would rather gave up making efforts to this and then will go on a private project on my own. alone.
